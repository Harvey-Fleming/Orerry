  planetName: Europa
  planetDesc: "Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust
    and probably an iron-nickel core. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily
    of oxygen. Cracks and streaks striate its surface, but craters are relatively
    few. Scientists are almost certain that hidden beneath the icy surface of Europa
    is a saltwater ocean with about twice as much water as Earth\u2019s global ocean."
