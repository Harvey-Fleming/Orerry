  planetDesc: "Jupiter\u2019s icy moon Ganymede is the largest moon in our solar
    system, even bigger than the planet Mercury, and the dwarf planet Pluto. There\u2019s
    strong evidence that Ganymede has an underground saltwater ocean that may hold
    more water than all the water on Earth's surface. It might even have ice and
    oceans stacked up in several layers like a club sandwich."
