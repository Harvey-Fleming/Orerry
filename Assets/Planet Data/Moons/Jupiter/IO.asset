  planetDesc: "Jupiter's rocky moon Io is the most volcanically active world in the
    solar system, with hundreds of volcanoes, some erupting lava fountains dozens
    of miles (or kilometers) high. Io\u2019s remarkable activity is the result of
    a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and smaller but precisely timed
    pulls from two neighboring moons that orbit farther from Jupiter \u2013 Europa
    and Ganymede."
